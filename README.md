# Pi_Doorbell
A raspberry pi based doorbell system

This system is a project based on my fustration with commercial applications available such as ring and others. These systems are proprietary, do not allow you full control over your devices, and MUST be connected to the internet to function properly. While it's nice to get alerts on your smartphone, I wanted to experiment with something that will work without the net, and more importantly without a monthly or yearly subscription. 

The Pi_Doorbell is a work in progress, and I offer no warranty expressed or implied. This is a personal project for non-commercial purposes. 

Main Features

1. Video recording capability upon button press.
2. Video recording capability upon motion detected. 

Desired/Future features. 

1. Email notification with photo/snapshot of camera subject (if internet connected - optional)
2. Possible hass.io integration.
3. Additional sensors (proximity, motion, heat, etc)
4. Additional cameras (pizero, esp32, other?)
5. TBD
